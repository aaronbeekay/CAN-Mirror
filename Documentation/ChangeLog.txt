V1.0
First Spin, no changes.

V1.1:
Changed standard button input to use GPIO21 instead of GPIO33
Changed pullup to avoid low voltage interrupt to COMP3A instead of COMP3B
RX0BF is now on GPIO22/pin1
RX1BF is now on GPIO32/pin2

V1.2:
Fixed issue where I had wroingly tied VDD to 3.3V instead of letting the internal 1.8V regulator drive them.

v1.3:
replaced Boot mode solder jumpers with 0603 resistor jumpers
